Mapping for Journalism
===================================

Analyzing and displaying spatial data is one of the most useful skills in your 
journalism toolkit. In this course you'll learn how to obtain geographic data,
how to run common types of analysis, and how to publish that analysis online
in a clear and appropriate way.

By the end of the course the student will have done at least 2 forms of analysis with resulting data nuts for stories. They will also have created at least 2 online maps using that data, plus one simple point map using geocoded data.
