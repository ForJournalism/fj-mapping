Hi, I'm Ken Schwencke, and I'm here to teach you all about analyis and mapping of geographic data.

Geographic data can mean a lot of things, but it's simply a way to communicate information with spatial relevance.

For example, let's say you want to meet a friend for lunch. You want to go to The Burger Barn, but you know there are two, and you know your friend is indecisive. 

"Let's eat at The Burger Barn on 8th and Flower. They close at 2, so leave soon."

In that simple sentence, you've just communicated a fair amount of information with a central geographic point. There's the restaurant's name, its address (the geographic info), and its closing time. Humans are great at communicating a bunch of information to eachother in free-form language, but computers really shine with structured information, so let's construct a table with all of that info:

Name | Address | Closing time
--- | --- | ---
Burger Barn | W 8th St & S Flower St, Los Angeles, CA |  14:00

This is geographic data, and a computer can use it. However, our location -- the address -- can be further refined so a computer can map the exact spot on the Earth without needing to know the ins and outs of downtown Los Angeles.

Humans have learned to readily understand and associate an address with a location, but we can turn that address into an exact point on the Earth's surface using a process called geocoding.

We will get to geocoding more in-depth in a bit, but for now, suffice it to say the same process that let's you type "134 Main St." into your phone, resulting in directions and a map to your dentist's office, can be harnessed for our own purposes.

There are many geocoders, but a decent and free web-based one for the US is geocoder.us. Go to http://geocoder.us in your browser, and type in "W 8th St & S Flower St, Los Angeles, CA" to the search box. Hit submit.

You should come up with this page here: http://geocoder.us/demo.cgi?address=W+8th+St+and+S+Flower+St%2C+Los+Angeles%2C+CA

Let's copy that latitude / longitude pair after the address and put it into our table. This is our new point data.

Name | Address | Point | Closing time
--- | --- | --- | ---
Burger Barn | W 8th St & S Flower St, Los Angeles, CA | 34.047281, -118.260155 | 14:00

If you want to verify this bizarre series of numbers means the same thing as our address, paste it into Google Maps: https://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.047281,-118.260155. Looks about right to me!

So that's point data. But what is latitude and longitude? For that we should go back to very basic geometry.

What you have here is a simple (x, y) plot of the point (3, 4). In the same way that (3, 4) describes a point on this grid, (34.047281, -118.260155) describes a point on a grid over the earth:
