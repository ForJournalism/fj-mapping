Hi, I'm Ken Schwencke, and I'm here to teach you all about analyis and mapping of geographic data.

Analyzing and displaying spatial data is one of the most useful skills in your journalism toolkit. In this course you'll learn how to obtain geographic data, how to run common types of analysis, and how to publish that analysis online in a clear and appropriate way.

Using geographic analysis, you can find stories you wouldn't be able to otherwise.
    - Potholes
    - 911
    - Parcels
    [basically, fill in with real examples]

Once you've got the analysis down, maps are a powerful method of communicating your results back to your readers. These days, maps are cheap and easy to make and publish online. But making a *good* map is still hard work that requires thoughtfulness and care. You don't want to publish misleading, inaccurate or just plain boring maps. By the end of this course, you should be able to craft useful and compelling maps.
