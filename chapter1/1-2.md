So that's latitude and longitude. They form the basis for geographic data. Understanding the underpinnings of the coordinate system is key to understanding how the rest of geographic information interacts and builds up. 

OK, so we have latitude and longitude, which toghether describe a geographic point on an Earth's surface. What other shapes can we make?

Well, there are lines:

[line1.geojson](resources/data/line1.geojson)

And when you connect those lines together you can make other shapes, like triangles:


[triangle]

And rectangles:

[rectangle]


you can even chain together polygons to create multipolygons, which can string together multiple shapes into a single object, like the Hawaiian islands:

[hawaii]
